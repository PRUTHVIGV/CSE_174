- **Skill development**: Helps learners build practical skills in:
  - Breed identification
  - Livestock management basics
  - Understanding government schemes and services
- **Accessibility**:
  - Mobile-friendly UI (works on phone via local IP)
  - Hindi breed names (scalable to regional languages)
- **Training support**:
